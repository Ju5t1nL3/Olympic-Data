# Olympic Data

The program allows the user to see formatted olympic data. They can see rankings of countries by bronze, silver, gold, or total medals. They can also look at all the events for a certain day, and filter it by country, discipline, or both. 

## How to Use

Simply pip install the libraries you don't have, and run the program! If you want to filter by country or discipline, the 3- letter codes can be found in the txt files attached in this repository.

### Disclaimer

The API used was written by a Brazilian person, so the country names are in Portuguese. Because this program is meant for American users, I translated all the country names into English. This caused the program to be a bit slower, so keep that in mind.

## Credits

Huge credits to the codante team, who created the Olympics API that updates in real time used for this project.
